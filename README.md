This repository host the data from our recent publication on Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy Multi-Dimensional Analysis of T-Cell Receptor Dynamics Predict T-Cell Signaling States (link to be added)

## Raw Data
Please find the raw data of all the cells imaged in the paper in the /Data folder. 

The `Variable_Definition.csv` file provides the definition of every feature and whether they are used in each part of the pipeline.

The other data files contain the raw data themselves, each sheet a different cell state as indicated by the filename.
